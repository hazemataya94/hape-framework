# HAPE Framework: Overview & Vision

## What is HAPE Framework?
HAPE Framework is a lightweight and extensible Python framework designed to help platform engineers build customized CLI and API-driven platforms with minimal effort. It provides a structured way to develop orchestrators for managing infrastructure, CI/CD pipelines, cloud resources, and other platform engineering needs. 

HAPE is built around abstraction and automation, allowing engineers to define and manage resources like AWS, Kubernetes, GitHub, GitLab, ArgoCD, Prometheus, Grafana, HashiCorp Vault, and many others in a unified manner. It eliminates the need to manually integrate multiple packages for each tool, offering a streamlined way to build self-service developer portals and engineering platforms. 

## Where It All Started
Modern organizations manage hundreds of microservices, each with its own infrastructure, CI/CD, monitoring, and deployment configurations. This complexity increases the cognitive load on developers and slows down platform operations. 

HAPE Framework aims to reduce this complexity by enabling platform engineers to build opinionated, yet flexible automation tools that simplify onboarding, deployment, and operations. 

With HAPE, developers can interact with a CLI or API to create, deploy, and manage their services without diving into complex configurations. The framework also supports custom workflows, state management via databases, and integration with existing DevOps tools. 

## Core Principles
- **Abstraction & Modularity** – Developers work with high-level constructs rather than low-level implement- ation details. 
- **CLI & API Driven** – HAPE enables both CLI and API-based interactions, making it ideal for automation. 
- **Extensibility** – Supports custom workflows, integrations, and automation logic.
- **Minimal Cognitive Load** – Aims to provide intuitive commands and automation, so platform engineers don’t need to reinvent the wheel.
- **Infrastructure & CI/CD Agnostic** – Can be adapted to any cloud provider, DevOps stack, or orchestration tool.
- **State Management via Database** – Unlike static configuration-based tools, HAPE tracks states dynamically using a database.

# Key Features
- Automated CRUD generation for platform services (e.g., hape crud --create ServiceName {...}).
- Built-in CLI framework that can be extended for various platform engineering use cases.
- Pre-built integrations with cloud providers and DevOps tools.
- Simplified orchestration of deployments, CI/CD, monitoring, and permissions.
- Database-backed state tracking for workflows and configurations.
- Python-based, for efficiency and language simplicity.
- Supports automation beyond platform engineering, making it useful for multiple domains.

## Vision for the Future
HAPE Framework aims to become the go-to tool for building Internal Developer Platforms (IDPs) and self-service DevOps automation. It envisions a future where platform engineers can quickly spin up customizable automation platforms without needing to start from scratch. 

The framework is flexible, it enables users to build fully managed solutions for CI/CD, infrastructure provisioning, developer access, cost monitoring, and beyond

While the framework itself remains agnostic, it enables users to build fully managed solutions for CI/CD, infrastructure provisioning, developer access, cost monitoring, and more. The long-term goal is to foster open-source community contributions to extend integrations and functionality.
